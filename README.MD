## Configuring BITBOT
In order to start the *BITBOT* software you have to create a folder in your **/etc** directory named ***bitbot*** and create a file named with your ***Crypto-PAIR.config***.
For example, if you need to operate on the BTC/USDT pair, you need to create the file **/etc/bitbot/BTCUSDT.config**.

You can start from the *BITBOT.ini* file that you can find in this repository.

The content is:

	[binance]
	api = 
	sek = 
	testneturl = 
	
	[Var]
	fiat = 25
	maxfiat = 2500
	limite = 3
	pausa = 120
	ferma = 0
	maxnonvendo = 0

In the *[binance]* block you have to place the API (api) and the Secret (sek) passphrase that you can find, or create, in your *Binance API Section*.
The *testneturl* can be blank if you operate on the official *Trading API* or you can fill with the testnet URL ***https://testnet.binance.vision/api***.

In the *[Var]* block you can specify the **BOT RULES**:
- *fiat* is the amount of *stable coin* to buy each time the bot want to buy a crypto asset.
- *maxfiat* is the maximum amount of *stable coin* that the bot can use.
- *limite*  is the maximum number of times that the crypto gain or loss.
- *pausa* is the time between a price check and another
. *ferma* is 0 if the bot will allways operate. If *ferma* is 1 the bot will stop operating at next gain and selling of cryptos.
. *maxnonvendo* ...

For each *BOT* you can copy a script with the name of the crypto pair. So you can run more than one *BOT* simultaneously.

You can run each bot manually in a dedicated terminal window.
